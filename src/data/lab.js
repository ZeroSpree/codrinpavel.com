It establishes a consistent approach to responsive design through fluid design tokens, a configurable grid system, automatic color shade generation, theme support, reusable components, and utility classes. Typography, spacing, sizing, radii, and shadows all derive from a shared token system, allowing designers to focus on mobile and desktop layouts while the system seamlessly scales every viewport in between, significantly reducing the effort required to design and build responsive websites.",

      overview: "YouTubeOnRepeat.com was my longest-running personal project and one of the early websites dedicated to looping YouTube videos, 6 years before YouTube introduced looping as a feature. Built on the YouTube API, it began as a PHP application, evolved into a jQuery-powered frontend, and ultimately became a Vue.js SPA. Users could save playlists and favorite videos without creating an account by leveraging the browser's then-new localStorage API, eliminating the need for a backend account system. At its peak, the site reached over 1 million monthly users with an average session duration of 45 minutes.",
